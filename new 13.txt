# Text-to-Speech Model Fine-Tuning Assignment

## Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to fine-tune two text-to-speech (TTS) models:
1. One model optimized to handle technical jargon commonly used in English technical interviews (e.g., "API," "CUDA," "TTS").
2. Another model fine-tuned for a regional language of your choice.

Additionally, the assignment explores ways to optimize the model for fast inference and investigates techniques such as quantization to reduce model size without compromising performance.
